Dataset must have the following format:  
- .csv file
- First row (header) will be ignored
- Every row should contain comma-separated coordinates (*d* in number) of one d-dimensional point
- File should contain *n* points (
    => *n* rows), excluding the header
 
 During execution, the user should specify *n* and *d* (may be <= than what is contained in the .csv).
